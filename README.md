Rubber Duck is a forum like a Github Issues or Stack Owerflow, where developers can post the problems they having with code, post answers or search and find similar to their own issues.Each quesiton and answered displays how many times it's been viewed, liked, disliked and when it was posted. I'ts been a really challenging project, as I had to work with lots of indices to identify which part of user's question or answer is text,  code or links and properly display it in UI. It's hosted at heroku: https://coding-forum.herokuapp.com/

I've used the following tools and libraries for this project:
* React.js
* Node.js
* Express.js
* MySQL/Sequelize
* Hilghlight.js for higlighting code 
* React Bootstrap
* Moment.js
